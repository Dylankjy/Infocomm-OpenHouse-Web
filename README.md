This website is meant to be used on an embedded system that has the ability to display webpages.
Repository was made for my CCA (school club) back when I was still in Secondary School for an open house event to demostrate how basic Python can be learnt within a few minutes.

Only on 18th March 2021 that this repository became public and open source.
